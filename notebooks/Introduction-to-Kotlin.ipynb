    "# Kotlin Programming\n",
    "This is an introduction to *Kotlin* programming.\n",
    "Kotlin is an open-source programming language that had been developed since 2011, with Kotlin 1.0 released in 2016. It became officially supported and widely available on Android in 2017. In 2019 it was promoted by Google to primary language for \"native\" Android development, replacing Java. Since then, Kotlin's popularity on Android has been rising.\n",
    "\n",
    "This introduction is designed for someone without requiring a background in programming.\n",
    "As such, it provides much of the mathematical background required for programming.\n",
    "The course uses [*Jupyter*](https://jupyter.org), which is an interactive environment that intermixes documentation with the ability to run program code, which allows learning how the language works while practicing programming at the same time.\n",
