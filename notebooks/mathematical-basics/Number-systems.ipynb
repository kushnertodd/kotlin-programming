    "As the numbers we wanted to track grew larger, the number of symbols used to show them would increase. The Roman approach was to use symbols for larger and larger numbers.\n",

    "Groups of symbols are added together to get numbers, so DCCXIV is 500 + 200 + 10 + 4 or 714.\n",
    "Large numbers could still need quite a few symbols. In India a new number system was created. Large numbers required even fewer symbols, and a smaller group of symbols could be used for any number. They are the symbols we are used to, the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Their form went through many changes from the original Indian version. We call them Arabic numerals because they were adopted into Arabic before we inherited them, but they are properly called Hindu-Arabic numerals.\n",

    "$2 x 2 x 2 = 2^2 x 2^1 = 4 x 2 = 8 = 2^3 = 2^{2+1}   $\n",
    "\n",
    "We have $2^2 x 2^1 = 8 = 2^3 = 2^{2+1}$. The value of multiplying the same number with different exponents is the same as that number to the value of adding the exponents.\n",

    "\n",
    "# Positional number systems\n",
    "\n",
    "The key new idea of the Indian system was to use only these symbols to create numbers. The difference from Roman Numerals was to use the position of the symbol to change its value. When the digit 1 is at the right of a number, its value is 1. When the digit 1 is one position to the left, in position 2, its value is 10. When the digit 1 is two positions to the left, in position 3, its value is 100.\n",

    "\n",
    "Now the value of a symbol is not determined by the symbol itself, but by the symbol and its position in the number. Symbols no longer must be repeated as in Roman numerals for a particular number because putting them in a different position gives them a different value. For the number 724 this is the value of the digits at each position.\n",

    "\n",
    "The final number is the sum of the values at each position: 700 + 20 + 4 = 724. Only one digit is needed for each position and the number of symbols used for each number now grows more slowly than for Roman Numerals.   \n",
    "There is one more thing needed for the new number system. If we want to show the number 305 in Roman Numerals, we use CCCV, or 3 hundreds, 5 ones with no tens. In the Indian system we need a digit in each position to give a value so that for 305, we have 305 = 300 + 5.\n",

    "\n",
    "To decide what digit goes in the second position, the Indian system had to invent the idea of a zero, the thing that is nothing and if multiplied by any number gives nothing. Like cell phones, you assume there never was a time that zero or cell phones were not around, but there was a time that zero did not yet exist. We need zero in the second position for this to work, so that we have 3 x 100 + 0 x 10 + 5 x 1 = 300 + 0 + 5 = 305.\n",

    "With the invention of zero and the system where each digit has a different value at each different position, we have the Hindu-Arabic number system. This system not only gave numbers of almost any size with the fewest number of symbols, but it made possible all of the abilities modern mathematics provides.\n",

    "We group counts by fives or tens in the Roman or Indian number systems maybe because we count on five and ten fingers. Why are groups of five or ten special? Suppose we used groups of a different size than five or ten? Maybe five or ten is no better than groups of another size.\n",

    "How do we replace groups of five or ten with another group size? In the Indian system, the value of a digit in one position is multiplied by 10 to find the value of that digit in the position to the left.
