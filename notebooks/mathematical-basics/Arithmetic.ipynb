    "## Operations on numbers\n",
    "Kotlin allows the expected basic operations on numbers: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, and Negation.\n",
    "Kotlin also supports the Modulo operation which gives the remainder of a division, after one number is divided by another. \n",
    "These operations use slightly different symbols in a program, for example because multiplying using `x` can be confused with the letter x, and trying to multiply using '$\\cdot$' is impossible because that is not a keyboard symbol. \n",
    "For example, `8 % 3` is 2 as shown here.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Basic-math-modulo.png\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "These operations have specific priorities for the order in which operations are applied. \n",
    "Negation has the highest priority, then multiplication, division, and modulo have the next priority, then addition and subtraction are the lowest.\n",
    "Parentheses, `(` and `)`, are used to change the operation order. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "|Operation |Symbol |Program |Priority |\n",
    "|:- |:- |:- |:- |\n",
    "|Negation |`-` |`-` |highest |\n",
    "|Multiplication |`x` or $\\cdot$ |* |next highest | \n",
    "|Division |$\\div$ |`/` |next highest | \n",
    "|Modulo |`%` |* |next highest | \n",
    "|Addition |`+` |`+` |lowest |\n",
    "|Subtraction |`-` |`-` |lowest |\n",
    "\n",
    "Operations of the same priority are applied left to right, so the order of operations for `3 + 6 - 2` is `(3 + 6) - 2`.\n",
    "For operations of different priorities, in programs it might sometimes be clearer and less error prone to use parentheses even if they not necessary, so `5 + 8 / 4 - 2` might be written as `5 + (8 / 4) - 2`. \n",
