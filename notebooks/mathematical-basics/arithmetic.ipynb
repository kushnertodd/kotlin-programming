    "## Exponents\n",
    "Exponents are a more compact way to represent repeated multiplication of the same number. \n",
    "The number of times a number is multiplied can be represented with an *exponent*.\n",
    "For example, multiplying 2 three times can be represented using an exponent of 3:\n",

    "There is one interesting result from this.\n",
    "We can create a number with an exponent of 0, $2^0$, or \"two multiplied 0 times\", where it is not obvious what that means.\n",
