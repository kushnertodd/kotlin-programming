    "# Inheritance\n",
    "Creating classes built upon existing classes.\n",
    "It allows specify a new implementation while maintaining the same behaviors (realizing an interface), to reuse code and to independently extend original software via public classes and interfaces\n",
    "enables you to create new classes that reuse, extend, and modify the behavior defined in other classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance enables you to create new classes that reuse, extend, and modify the behavior defined in other classes. The class whose members are inherited is called the base class, and the class that inherits those members is called the derived class. A derived class can have only one direct base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "An inherited class is called a subclass of its parent class or super class. The term \"inheritance\" is loosely used for both class-based and prototype-based programming, but in narrow use the term is reserved for class-based programming (one class inherits from another), with the corresponding technique in prototype-based programming being instead called delegation (one object delegates to another). Class-modifying inheritance patterns can be pre-defined according to simple network interface parameters such that inter-language compatibility is preserved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance, along with abstraction, encapsulation, and polymorphism, is one of the four primary concepts in Object-Oriented Programming.\n",
    "\n",
    " specifying objects that belonged to different classes but had common properties. The common properties were collected in a superclass, and each superclass could itself potentially have a superclass. The values of a subclass were thus compound objects, consisting of some number of prefix parts belonging to various superclasses, plus a main part belonging to the subclass. These parts were all concatenated together. The attributes of a compound object would be accessible by dot notation. \n",
    " \n",
    " When you define a class to derive from another class, the derived class implicitly gains all the members of the base class, except for its constructors and finalizers. The derived class reuses the code in the base class without having to reimplement it. You can add more members in the derived class. The derived class extends the functionality of the base class.\n",
    " \n",
    " In the preceding lessons, you have seen inheritance mentioned several times. In the Java language, classes can be derived from other classes, thereby inheriting fields and methods from those classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Definitions: A class that is derived from another class is called a subclass (also a derived class, extended class, or child class). The class from which the subclass is derived is called a superclass (also a base class or a parent class).\n",
    "\n",
    "Excepting Object, which has no superclass, every class has one and only one direct superclass (single inheritance). In the absence of any other explicit superclass, every class is implicitly a subclass of Object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes can be derived from classes that are derived from classes that are derived from classes, and so on, and ultimately derived from the topmost class, Object. Such a class is said to be descended from all the classes in the inheritance chain stretching back to Object.\n",
    "The idea of inheritance is simple but powerful: When you want to create a new class and there is already a class that includes some of the code that you want, you can derive your new class from the existing class. In doing this, you can reuse the fields and methods of the existing class without having to write (and debug!) them yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "A subclass inherits all the members (fields, methods, and nested classes) from its superclass. Constructors are not members, so they are not inherited by subclasses, but the constructor of the superclass can be invoked from the subclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "we can use inheritance when we know there is an \"is a\" relationship between a child and its parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Composition over inheritance (or composite reuse principle) in object-oriented programming (OOP) is the principle that classes should favor polymorphic behavior and code reuse by their composition (by containing instances of other classes that implement the desired functionality) over inheritance from a base or parent class.\n",

    "## Composition\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is contrasted with object composition, where one object contains another object (or objects of one class contain objects of another class); see composition over inheritance. Composition implements a has-a relationship, in contrast to the is-a relationship of subtyping.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes and objects created through inheritance are tightly coupled because changing the parent or superclass in an inheritance relationship risks breaking your code. Classes and objects created through composition are loosely coupled, meaning that you can more easily change the component parts without breaking your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In object-oriented programming, we can use composition in cases where one object \"has\" (or is part of) another object. \n",
    "\n",
    "multiple inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "In object-oriented programming, inheritance, and composition are two fundamental techniques for creating complex software systems. Inheritance is the mechanism by which a new class is derived from an existing class, inheriting all of its properties and methods. Composition, on the other hand, is the technique of building complex objects by combining simpler objects, rather than inheriting from a base class. \n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between inheritance and composition is that classes and objects in inheritance code are tightly coupled, meaning that they should not be changed because changing the parent or superclass risks changing the sub-class, or child class, thus breaking your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In composition, on the other hand, classes and objects are loosely coupled, meaning you can more easily switch up these components without breaking the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tends to make the composition more flexible, so many developers believe it to be superior to inheritance - but this is oversimplifying the matter.\n",
    "Because loosely coupled code offers more flexibility, many developers have learned that composition is a better technique than inheritance, but the truth is more complex. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the primary advantages of composition over inheritance is that it provides greater flexibility in designing and implementing software systems. With composition, we can create complex objects by combining simple objects in different ways, depending on our needs. This means that we can build more modular and reusable code that can adapt to different requirements without the need for extensive modification.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this way, we can create a more flexible and modular design that allows us to create new combinations of behaviors without the need for extensive modification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Composition over inheritance (or composite reuse principle) in object-oriented programming (OOP) is the principle that classes should favor polymorphic behavior and code reuse by their composition (by containing instances of other classes that implement the desired functionality) over inheritance from a base or parent class. Ideally all reuse can be achieved by assembling existing components, but in practice inheritance is often needed to make new ones. Therefore inheritance and object composition typically work hand-in-hand, as discussed in the book Design Patterns (1994).\n",
    "\n",
    "An implementation of composition over inheritance typically begins with the creation of various interfaces representing the behaviors that the system must exhibit. Interfaces can facilitate polymorphic behavior. Classes implementing the identified interfaces are built and added to business domain classes as needed. Thus, system behaviors are realized without inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "object composition and object aggregation are closely related ways to combine objects or data types into more complex ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Object composition is about combining objects within compound objects, and at the same time, ensuring the encapsulation of each object by using their well-defined interface without visibility of their internals"
