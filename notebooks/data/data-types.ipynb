    "*Data types* describe the type of [*data*](../mathematical-basics/data.ipynb) stored by variables and collections of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "A data type (or simply a *type*) is a collection or grouping of data values, usually specified by a set of possible values, a set of allowed operations on these values, and/or a representation of these values as built-in user-defined and [primitive types](../variables/variables.ipynb/#variable-types) such as integers (of varying sizes), floating-point numbers (which approximate real numbers), characters and booleans.\n",
    "Types may be a composite or aggregate  collection of individual  items of a given data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data is stored in a computer as a sequence of symbols represented by [binary numbers](../mathematical-basics/number-systems.ipynb#binary-numbers).\n",
    "These symbols have no meaning of their own, they only have one when the sender and receiver agree as to their meaning.\n",
    "Primitive types have behavior closely tied to their binary representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### User-defined types\n",
    "*User-defined* types are defined based on primitive types and other user-defined types.\n",
    "\n",
    "The information stored in a type can include the following items:\n",
    "- The storage space that a variable of the type requires.\n",
    "- The values that it can represent.\n",
    "- The kinds of operations that are permitted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every variable and constant has a type, as does every expression that evaluates to a value. \n",
    "Every function declaration specifies a name, the type and kind (value, reference, or output) for each input parameter and for the return value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The compiler uses type information to make sure all operations that are performed in your code are type safe\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three major data types.\n",
    "- Primitive data types such as numbers, text, and booleans\n",
    "- Collections of data\n",
    "- Classes that combine data with function or *methods*\n",
    "\n",
