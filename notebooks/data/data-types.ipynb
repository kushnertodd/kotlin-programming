    "*Data types* describe the type of [*data*](../mathematical-basics/Data.ipynb) stored by variables and collections of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "In computer science and computer programming, a data type (or simply type) is a collection or grouping of data values, usually specified by a set of possible values, a set of allowed operations on these values, and/or a representation of these values as machine types. A data type specification in a program constrains the possible values that an expression, such as a variable or a function call, might take. On literal data, it tells the compiler or interpreter how the programmer intends to use the data. Most programming languages support basic data types of integer numbers (of varying sizes), floating-point numbers (which approximate real numbers), characters and Booleans.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data types may be categorized according to several factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "Primitive data types or built-in data types are types that are built-in to a language implementation. User-defined data types are non-primitive types. For example, Java's numeric types are primitive, while classes are user-defined.\n",
    "A value of an atomic type is a single data item that cannot be broken into component parts. A value of a composite type or aggregate type is a collection of data items that can be accessed individually. For example, an integer is generally considered atomic, although it consists of a sequence of bits, while an array of integers is certainly composite.\n",
    "Basic data types or fundamental data types are defined axiomatically from fundamental notions or by enumeration of their elements. Generated data types or derived data types are specified, and partly defined, in terms of other data types. All basic types are atomic. For example, integers are a basic type defined in mathematics, while an array of integers is the result of applying an array type generator to the integer type.\n",
    "\n",
    "The information stored in a type can include the following items:\n",
    "The storage space that a variable of the type requires.\n",
    "The maximum and minimum values that it can represent.\n",
    "The members (methods, fields, events, and so on) that it contains.\n",
    "The base type it inherits from.\n",
    "The interface(s) it implements.\n",
    "The kinds of operations that are permitted.\n",
    "\n",
    ". Every variable and constant has a type, as does every expression that evaluates to a value. Every method declaration specifies a name, the type and kind (value, reference, or output) for each input parameter and for the return value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The compiler uses type information to make sure all operations that are performed in your code are type safe\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three major data types.\n",
    "- Primitive data types such as numbers, text, and booleans\n",
    "- Collections of data\n",
    "- Classes that combine data with function or *methods*\n",
